# 💻 Data Types in C++

## 🎯 Aim

To understand and explore various **primitive data types** in programming, with a focus on their usage in **C++**.

---

## 📚 Theory

Primitive data types are the fundamental building blocks of any programming language. In C++, they are used to store and manipulate basic forms of data such as numbers, characters, and logical values.

## 🔢 Common Data Types in C++

| Data Type | Description                                      | Example                         |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `int`     | Stores whole numbers without decimals            | `int marks = 25;`               |
| `float`   | Stores single-precision decimal numbers          | `float x = 3.2f;`               |
| `double`  | Stores double-precision decimal numbers          | `double a = 9.97585858;`        |
| `char`    | Stores a single character                        | `char initial = 'A';`           |
| `bool`    | Stores logical values: `true` or `false`         | `bool isStudent = true;`        |
| `string`  | Stores a sequence of characters (text)           | `string name = "Aditya";`       |

> 🛠️ **Note**: In C++, `string` is part of the Standard Library and requires:
> ```cpp
> #include <string>
> using std::string;
> ```

## 🧠 Conclusion

Mastering data types is essential for writing **reliable**, **efficient**, and **expressive** programs. Each type—whether it's an integer for counting, a float for precision, or a string for text—serves a unique purpose in representing and manipulating information.

By understanding how and when to use these types, you lay the groundwork for structured logic, memory management, and robust application development in C++. 🧱💻
